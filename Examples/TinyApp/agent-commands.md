# TinyApp agent commands

> **GENERATED** by `swift run tinyctl docs` from the `+Agent.swift` files. Do not edit by hand; run `swift run tinyctl docs` instead.

TinyApp is the example app in this repository: a list, a detail screen and one mocked client.
Every screen is driven with the same commands, headlessly (`swift run tinyctl run "…"`) or from a
scenario file (`Examples/TinyApp/scenarios/*.appctl`).

## Script syntax

- Commands are separated by `;` or newlines. `#` starts a comment.
- A command's argument is the rest of the line: `<command> a value with spaces`.
- Double quotes protect `;` and `#`: `<command> "a;b#c"`. Inside quotes, `\"` is a quote.
- After each command the app settles and one step is printed:

  ```text
  > open 2
    screen=items/2 title="Second item" saved=false cooldown=0
  ```

  The line holds `screen`, the screen's summary keys, `calls=` (mock calls made during the step),
  `error=` (if set) and `pending=` (effects waiting on the clock, e.g. a countdown; headlessly
  `advance <duration>` releases them).
- Exit codes: `0` all steps passed, `1` a command or `expect` failed, `2` usage or parse error, `3` internal error.

## Examples

```bash
swift run tinyctl run "open 2; save"                       # save the second item
swift run tinyctl run "open 2; save; advance 3s"            # let the cooldown run out
swift run tinyctl run "mock items.fetch network; refresh"   # make the next fetch fail
swift run tinyctl test                                     # run every scenario
```

Scenarios in `Examples/TinyApp/scenarios/*.appctl` use the same syntax plus `expect` lines; `swift run tinyctl test` runs them.

## Runtime commands (every screen)

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `expect k=v [k=v …]` | Assert on screen, any summary key, call=<client.method> (called during the previous step), error=<code\|none> or pending=<n>. A failed assertion fails the script. |
| `advance <duration>` | Advance the test clock, e.g. 500ms, 30s, 5m, 1h. Headless only. |
| `mock <client.method> <error>` | Make the next call to that method fail, e.g. mock <client.method> <error>. |

## Screens

### `items`

Screen: `Items`.
Summary keys: `items`, `loading`.

| Command | Description | From |
|---|---|---|
| `open <id>` | Open an item, e.g. open 2. *(disabled when items=0)* | Items |
| `refresh` | Load the list again. | Items |
| `retry` | Load the list again after a failure. *(disabled when error=none)* | Items |

### `items/<id>`

Screen: `ItemDetail`.
Summary keys: `title`, `saved`, `cooldown`.

| Command | Description | From |
|---|---|---|
| `save` | Save this item. A save starts a 3-second cooldown; saving again before it runs out reports error=cooldown. | ItemDetail |
| `back` | Go back to the list. | TinyRoot |

## Mockable methods

`mock <method> <error>` makes the next call to the method throw that error.

| Method | Errors |
|---|---|
| `items.fetch` | `network`, `timeout` |

## The example's data

`items.fetch` always returns three items: `First item`, `Second item` and `Third item`.
A `save` starts a 3-second cooldown; saving again before it runs out reports
`error=cooldown`. Headlessly, `advance 3s` runs the countdown out at once.
`open <id>` with an id the list does not have reports `error=notFound` instead of doing nothing.
